## REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

### What Success Looks Like (Base Case)

**Week 1-2:** Mostly quiet, building and testing  
- 0-3 sales per day
- Lots of learning and iteration
- Building confidence in product

**Week 3-4:** Early momentum  
- 5-15 sales per day
- First positive feedback
- Marketing starts to click
- Still feels like pushing a boulder uphill

**Week 5-6:** Clear traction  
- 15-40 sales per day
- Word of mouth visible
- Less effort per sale
- Feels like real business

**Week 7-8:** Peak season  
- 40-65 sales per day
- Multiple marketing channels working
- Operational focus (fulfilling orders)
- Confidence in business model

### What's Hard (Be Honest With Yourself)

**Technical Challenges:**
- API integration will have bugs
- Payment processing will fail occasionally
- You'll have to deal with customer complaints
- Image quality won't always be perfect

**Marketing Challenges:**
- Most of your posts will flop (that's normal)
- You'll feel like you're spamming your friends
- Reddit posts might get downvoted/removed
- TikTok algorithm is unpredictable

**Psychological Challenges:**
- Week 1-2: Imposter syndrome ("Who am I to charge for this?")
- Week 3: Doubt ("Is anyone actually going to buy?")
- Week 4: Comparison ("Competitor X is better than me")
- Week 5: Burnout ("Do I really want to do marketing every day?")

**The Reality:** 
If you can push through these moments and keep shipping, you'll likely hit the base case ($14K-18K). Most people quit during Week 3-4 when growth is slow.

## WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE BEHIND PACE

### Week 3: Less than $500 revenue
**Problem:** Product or marketing not working  
**Action:**
- Survey first 10 customers: why did they buy?
- Ask 10 friends: why didn't they buy?
- Adjust pricing or marketing message
- Consider paid ads to validate demand

### Week 5: Less than $3,000 revenue
**Problem:** Not reaching target audience effectively  
**Action:**
- Double down on one channel (pick Reddit or TikTok)
- Create 10 variations of your best-performing content
- Offer limited-time discount ($14.99 for 24 hours)
- Personal outreach to 50 relevant people

### Week 7: Less than $8,000 revenue
**Problem:** Fundamental product-market fit issue  
**Action:**
- Pivot to B2B (sell to fraternities, student orgs)
- Add rush processing ($39 for 1-hour delivery)
- Create team packages (5 people for $75)
- Consider lowering prices significantly

## BEYOND 60 DAYS: WHAT'S NEXT?

### Option 1: Cash Out & Move On
**What:** Shut down marketing, fulfill remaining orders, close shop  
**Best For:** You just wanted quick cash for semester  
**Expected:** No ongoing revenue, one-time $15K-30K profit

### Option 2: Maintain as Side Business
**What:** Reduce marketing to 5 hours/week, keep running  
**Best For:** Passive income while you focus on school/job  
**Expected:** $500-2,000/month with minimal effort

### Option 3: Build Recurring Revenue
**What:** Add subscription tier, B2B corporate accounts  
**Best For:** Building real startup, not just project  
**Expected:** $5K-15K MRR by month 6

### Option 4: Sell the Business
**What:** List on marketplaces (Acquire.com, Flippa)  
**Best For:** Max cash out, someone else scales  
**Expected:** 2-3x annual profit = $30K-60K sale price

## THE HONEST TRUTH

### This Projection Assumes You:

✅ Actually launch before January 10

✅ Respond to every customer within 2 hours  
✅ Don't quit when Week 2-3 feels slow  
✅ Fix bugs and quality issues immediately  
✅ Ask friends/family for help promoting  
✅ Are willing to feel uncomfortable marketing yourself  

### This WON'T Work If You:

❌ Wait until "everything is perfect" to launch  
❌ Post marketing content inconsistently  
❌ Let customer questions sit for 24+ hours  
❌ Quit after first week when sales are slow  
❌ Ignore negative feedback or refund requests  
❌ Are too embarrassed to tell people about it  
❌ Expect passive income without active work
